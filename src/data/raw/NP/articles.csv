Drug delivery and nanoparticles:applications and hazards.,"The use of nanotechnology in medicine and more specifically drug delivery is set to spread rapidly. Currently many substances are under investigation for drug delivery and more specifically for cancer therapy. Interestingly pharmaceutical sciences are using nanoparticles to reduce toxicity and side effects of drugs and up to recently did not realize that carrier systems themselves may impose risks to the patient. The kind of hazards that are introduced by using nanoparticles for drug delivery are beyond that posed by conventional hazards imposed by chemicals in classical delivery matrices. For nanoparticles the knowledge on particle toxicity as obtained in inhalation toxicity shows the way how to investigate the potential hazards of nanoparticles. The toxicology of particulate matter differs from toxicology of substances as the composing chemical(s) may or may not be soluble in biological matrices, thus influencing greatly the potential exposure of various internal organs. This may vary from a rather high local exposure in the lungs and a low or neglectable exposure for other organ systems after inhalation. However, absorbed species may also influence the potential toxicity of the inhaled particles. For nanoparticles the situation is different as their size opens the potential for crossing the various biological barriers within the body. From a positive viewpoint, especially the potential to cross the blood brain barrier may open new ways for drug delivery into the brain. In addition, the nanosize also allows for access into the cell and various cellular compartments including the nucleus. A multitude of substances are currently under investigation for the preparation of nanoparticles for drug delivery, varying from biological substances like albumin, gelatine and phospholipids for liposomes, and more substances of a chemical nature like various polymers and solid metal containing nanoparticles. It is obvious that the potential interaction with tissues and cells, and the potential toxicity, greatly depends on the actual composition of the nanoparticle formulation. This paper provides an overview on some of the currently used systems for drug delivery. Besides the potential beneficial use also attention is drawn to the questions how we should proceed with the safety evaluation of the nanoparticle formulations for drug delivery. For such testing the lessons learned from particle toxicity as applied in inhalation toxicology may be of use. Although for pharmaceutical use the current requirements seem to be adequate to detect most of the adverse effects of nanoparticle formulations, it can not be expected that all aspects of nanoparticle toxicology will be detected. So, probably additional more specific testing would be needed."
Engineering precision nanoparticles for drug delivery.,"In recent years, the development of nanoparticles has expanded into a broad range of clinical applications. Nanoparticles have been developed to overcome the limitations of free therapeutics and navigate biological barriers - systemic, microenvironmental and cellular - that are heterogeneous across patient populations and diseases. Overcoming this patient heterogeneity has also been accomplished through precision therapeutics, in which personalized interventions have enhanced therapeutic efficacy. However, nanoparticle development continues to focus on optimizing delivery platforms with a one-size-fits-all solution. As lipid-based, polymeric and inorganic nanoparticles are engineered in increasingly specified ways, they can begin to be optimized for drug delivery in a more personalized manner, entering the era of precision medicine. In this Review, we discuss advanced nanoparticle designs utilized in both non-personalized and precision applications that could be applied to improve precision therapies. We focus on advances in nanoparticle design that overcome heterogeneous barriers to delivery, arguing that intelligent nanoparticle design can improve efficacy in general delivery applications while enabling tailored designs for precision applications, thereby ultimately improving patient outcome overall."
Polymeric Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery.,"The recent emergence of nanomedicine has revolutionized the therapeutic landscape and necessitated the creation of more sophisticated drug delivery systems. Polymeric nanoparticles sit at the forefront of numerous promising drug delivery designs, due to their unmatched control over physiochemical properties such as size, shape, architecture, charge, and surface functionality. Furthermore, polymeric nanoparticles have the ability to navigate various biological barriers to precisely target specific sites within the body, encapsulate a diverse range of therapeutic cargo and efficiently release this cargo in response to internal and external stimuli. However, despite these remarkable advantages, the presence of polymeric nanoparticles in wider clinical application is minimal. This review will provide a comprehensive understanding of polymeric nanoparticles as drug delivery vehicles. The biological barriers affecting drug delivery will be outlined first, followed by a comprehensive description of the various nanoparticle designs and preparation methods, beginning with the polymers on which they are based. The review will meticulously explore the current performance of polymeric nanoparticles against a myriad of diseases including cancer, viral and bacterial infections, before finally evaluating the advantages and crucial challenges that will determine their wider clinical potential in the decades to come."
Drug-delivery nanoparticles for bone-tissue and dental applications.,"The use of nanoparticles as biomaterials with applications in the biomedical field is growing every day. These nanomaterials can be used as contrast imaging agents, combination therapy agents, and targeted delivery systems in medicine and dentistry. Usually, nanoparticles are found as synthetic or natural organic materials, such as hydroxyapatite, polymers, and lipids. Besides that, they are could also be inorganic, for instance, metallic or metal-oxide-based particles. These inorganic nanoparticles could additionally present magnetic properties, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. The use of nanoparticles as drug delivery agents has many advantages, for they help diminish toxicity effects in the body since the drug dose reduces significantly, increases drugs biocompatibility, and helps target drugs to specific organs. As targeted-delivery agents, one of the applications uses nanoparticles as drug delivery particles for bone-tissue to treat cancer, osteoporosis, bone diseases, and dental treatments such as periodontitis. Their application as drug delivery agents requires a good comprehension of the nanoparticle properties and composition, alongside their synthesis and drug attachment characteristics. Properties such as size, shape, core-shell designs, and magnetic characteristics can influence their behavior inside the human body and modify magnetic properties in the case of magnetic nanoparticles. Based on that, many different studies have modified the synthesis methods for these nanoparticles and developed composite systems for therapeutics delivery, adapting, and improving magnetic properties, shell-core designs, and particle size and nanosystems characteristics. This review presents the most recent studies that have been presented with different nanoparticle types and structures for bone and dental drug delivery."
Nano-drug co-delivery system of natural active ingredients and chemotherapy drugs for cancer treatment: a review.,"Chemotherapy drugs have been used for a long time in the treatment of cancer, but serious side effects are caused by the inability of the drug to be solely delivered to the tumor when treating cancer with chemotherapy. Natural products have attracted more and more attention due to the antitumor effect in multiple ways, abundant resources and less side effects. Therefore, the combination of natural active ingredients and chemotherapy drugs may be an effective antitumor strategy, which can inhibit the growth of tumor and multidrug resistance, reduce side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Nano-drug co-delivery system (NDCDS) can play an important role in the combination of natural active ingredients and chemotherapy drugs. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the research status and application prospect of nano-delivery strategies for the combination of natural active ingredients and chemotherapy drugs, aiming to provide a basis for the development of anti-tumor drugs."
Gold nanoparticles for skin drug delivery.,"Nanoparticle-based drug carriers are being pursued intensely to overcome the skin barrier and improve even hydrophilic or macromolecular drug delivery into or across the skin efficiently. Over the past few years, the application of gold nanoparticles as a novel kind of drug carrier for skin drug delivery has attracted increasing attention because of their unique properties and versatility. In this review, we summarized the possible factors contributing to the penetration behaviors of gold nanoparticles, including size, surface chemistry, and shape. Drug loading, release, and penetration patterns were captured towards implicating the design of gold nanoparticles for dermal or transdermal drug delivery. Physical methods applicable for future enhancing the delivery efficacy of GNPs were also presented, which mainly included microneedles and iontophoresis. As a promising ""drug"", the inherent activities of GNPs were finally discussed, especially regarding their application in the treatment of skin disease. Thus, this paper provided a comprehensive review of the use of gold nanoparticles for skin drug delivery, which would help the design of multifunctional systems for skin drug delivery based on gold nanoparticles."

These nano-delivery systems target-oriented delivery of drugs with precision at several site-specific, with mild toxicity, prolonged circulation time, high solubility, and long retention time in the biological system, which circumvent the problems associated with the conventional delivery approach. Recently, nanocarriers such as dendrimers, liposomes, nanotubes, and nanoparticles have been extensively investigated through structural characteristics, size manipulation, and selective diagnosis through disease imaging molecules, which are very effective and introduce a new paradigm shift in drugs. In this review, the use of nanomedicines in drug delivery has been demonstrated in treating various diseases with significant advances and applications in different fields. In addition, this review discusses the current challenges and future directions for research in these promising fields as well."
Novel Drug and Gene Delivery System and Imaging Agent Based on Marine Diatom Biosilica Nanoparticles.,"Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have great potential for applications as a drug delivery system (DDS) due to their unique properties such as large pore size, high surface area, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and stable aqueous dispersion. The MSN-mediated DDS can carry chemotherapeutic agents, optical sensors, photothermal agents, short interfering RNA (siRNA), and gene therapeutic agents. The MSN-assisted imaging techniques are applicable in cancer diagnosis. However, their synthesis via a chemical route requires toxic chemicals and is challenging, time-consuming, and energy-intensive, making the process expensive and non-viable. Fortunately, nature has provided a viable alternative material in the form of biosilica from marine resources. In this review, the applications of biosilica nanoparticles synthesized from marine diatoms in the field of drug delivery, biosensing, imaging agents, and regenerative medicine, are highlighted. Insights into the use of biosilica in the field of DDSs are elaborated, with a focus on different strategies to improve the physico-chemical properties with regards to drug loading and release efficiency, targeted delivery, and site-specific binding capacity by surface functionalization. The limitations, as well as the future scope to develop them as potential drug delivery vehicles and imaging agents, in the overall therapeutic management, are discussed."
"Protein-based Nanoparticles: From Drug Delivery to Imaging, Nanocatalysis and Protein Therapy.","Proteins and enzymes are versatile biomaterials for a wide range of medical applications due to their high specificity for receptors and substrates, high degradability, low toxicity, and overall good biocompatibility. Protein nanoparticles are formed by the arrangement of several native or modified proteins into nanometer-sized assemblies. In this review, we will focus on artificial nanoparticle systems, where proteins are the main structural element and not just an encapsulated payload. While under natural conditions, only certain proteins form defined aggregates and nanoparticles, chemical modifications or a change in the physical environment can further extend the pool of available building blocks. This allows the assembly of many globular proteins and even enzymes. These advances in preparation methods led to the emergence of new generations of nanosystems that extend beyond transport vehicles to diverse applications, from multifunctional drug delivery to imaging, nanocatalysis and protein therapy."
"Shear-, Sound-, and Light-Sensitive Nanoparticles for Thrombolytic Drug Delivery.","Thrombotic diseases, as potentially induced by blood clots or vascular embolization, frequently occur with high rates of mortalities worldwide. Current drug thrombolysis, a primary clinical therapy, may increase fatal risk of hemorrhage when thrombolysis agents become systemically distributed. Given current thrombolysis limitations, some novel drug delivery systems based on nanoparticles have been recently exploited to achieve a more controlled release of loaded thrombolytic agents, able to respond to environmental changes, and resulting in a safer thrombolysis. In this review, the authors outline and discuss some prominent examples of early and recent thrombolytic agent delivery systems using controlled release by physical stimuli (shear, sound and light). Shear-sensitive systems are designed to exploit the specific biomechanical feature of thrombosis, that is, the increased blood shear stress. Sound- and light-sensitive systems reflect ""remote control"" of drug release by responding to external ultrasound or light stimulus. These smart thrombolytic drug delivery systems hold promise for more effective and safer future thrombolytic therapy."
Controlled drug delivery systems: past forward and future back.,"Controlled drug delivery technology has progressed over the last six decades. This progression began in 1952 with the introduction of the first sustained release formulation. The 1st generation of drug delivery (1950-1980) focused on developing oral and transdermal sustained release systems and establishing controlled drug release mechanisms. The 2nd generation (1980-2010) was dedicated to the development of zero-order release systems, self-regulated drug delivery systems, long-term depot formulations, and nanotechnology-based delivery systems. The latter part of the 2nd generation was largely focused on studying nanoparticle formulations. The Journal of Controlled Release (JCR) has played a pivotal role in the 2nd generation of drug delivery technologies, and it will continue playing a leading role in the next generation. The best path towards a productive 3rd generation of drug delivery technology requires an honest, open dialog without any preconceived ideas of the past. The drug delivery field needs to take a bold approach to designing future drug delivery formulations primarily based on today's necessities, to produce the necessary innovations. The JCR provides a forum for sharing the new ideas that will shape the 3rd generation of drug delivery technology."

Among others, with superior biocompatibility and enhanced targeting capacity, albumin appears to be a promising carrier for drug delivery. Albumin nanoparticles are highly favored in many disease therapies, as they have the proper chemical groups for modification, cell-binding sites for cell adhesion, and affinity to protein drugs for nanocomplex generation. Herein, this review summarizes the recent fabrication techniques, modification strategies, and application of albumin nanoparticles. We first discuss various albumin nanoparticle fabrication methods, from both pros and cons. Then, we provide a comprehensive introduction to the modification section, including organic albumin nanoparticles, metal albumin nanoparticles, inorganic albumin nanoparticles, and albumin nanoparticle-based hybrids. We finally bring further perspectives on albumin nanoparticles used for various critical diseases."
"Nanoparticles as Drug Delivery Carrier-synthesis, Functionalization and Application.","In recent years, advancements in chemistry have allowed the tailoring of materials at the nanoscopic level as needed. There are mainly four main types of nanomaterials used as drug carriers:metal-based nanomaterials, organic nanomaterials, inorganic nanomaterials, and polymer nanomaterials. The nanomaterials as a drug carrier showed advantages for decreased side effects with a higher therapeutic index. The stability of the drug compounds are increased by encapsulation of the drug within the nano-drug carriers, leading to decreased systemic toxicity. Nano-drug carriers are also used for controlled drug release by tailoring system-made solubility characteristics of nanoparticles by surface coating with surfactants. The review focuses on the different types of nanoparticles used as drug carriers, the nanoparticle synthesis process, techniques of nanoparticle surface coating for drug carrier purposes, applications of nano-drug carriers, and prospects of nanomaterials as drug carriers for biomedical applications."
"Nano drug-delivery systems for management of AIDS: liposomes, dendrimers, gold and silver nanoparticles.","AIDS causes increasing mortality every year. With advancements in nanomedicine, different nanomaterials (NMs) have been applied to treat AIDS and overcome its limitations. Among different NMs, nanoparticles (NPs) can act as nanocarriers due to their enhanced solubility, sustained release, targeting abilities and facilitation of drug-dose reductions. This review discusses recent advancements in therapeutics for AIDS/HIV using various NMs, mainly focused on three classifications: polymeric, liposomal and inorganic NMs. Polymeric dendrimers, polyethylenimine-NPs, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-NPs, chitosan and the use of liposomal-based delivery systems and inorganic NPs, including gold and silver NPs, are explored. Recent advances, current challenges and future perspectives on the use of these NMs for better management of HIV/AIDS are also discussed."
Lipoprotein Like Nanoparticles Used in Drug and Gene Delivery.,"Native lipoproteins as nanoparticulate drug delivery systems have gained considerable attention in recent years. This is due to their biocompatibility, being endogenous, no triggering the immunological responses, relatively long half-life in the circulation, simple diffusion from vascular to extravascular compartments due to their nanometric particle size, potentially targeting capability to cellular receptors, simple preparative processes in the reconstituted forms, easy functionalization and high capacity for drug loading. Clinical application of many therapeutic agents like anticancer drugs and genes is hampered due to their susceptibility to degradation and difficult delivery into cells. Several nanoparticle platforms for siRNA delivery have been developed to overcome the major limitations facing the therapeutic uses of bioactive therapeutic agents."
Advances in Drug Delivery Systems Based on Red Blood Cells and Their Membrane-Derived Nanoparticles.,"Red blood cells (RBCs) and RBC membrane-derived nanoparticles have been historically developed as bioinspired drug delivery systems to combat the issues of premature clearance, toxicity, and immunogenicity of synthetic nanocarriers. RBC-based delivery systems possess characteristics including biocompatibility, biodegradability, and long circulation time, which make them suited for systemic administration. Therefore, they have been employed in designing optimal drug formulations in various preclinical models and clinical trials to treat a wide range of diseases. In this review, we provide an overview of the biology, synthesis, and characterization of drug delivery systems based on RBCs and their membrane including whole RBCs, RBC membrane-camouflaged nanoparticles, RBC-derived extracellular vesicles, and RBC hitchhiking. We also highlight conventional and latest engineering strategies, along with various therapeutic modalities, for enhanced precision and effectiveness of drug delivery. Additionally, we focus on the current state of RBC-based therapeutic applications and their clinical translation as drug carriers, as well as discussing opportunities and challenges associated with these systems."
Applications of nanoparticles for diagnosis and therapy of cancer.,"During the last decades, a plethora of nanoparticles have been developed and evaluated and a real hype has been created around their potential application as diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Despite their suggestion as potential diagnostic agents, only a single diagnostic nanoparticle formulation, namely iron oxide nanoparticles, has found its way into clinical routine so far. This fact is primarily due to difficulties in achieving appropriate pharmacokinetic properties and a reproducible synthesis of monodispersed nanoparticles. Furthermore, concerns exist about their biodegradation, elimination and toxicity. The majority of nanoparticle formulations that are currently routinely used in the clinic are used for therapeutic purposes. These therapeutic nanoparticles aim to more efficiently deliver a (chemo-) therapeutic drug to the pathological site, while avoiding its accumulation in healthy organs and tissues, and are predominantly based on the ""enhanced permeability and retention"" (EPR) effect. Furthermore, based on their ability to integrate diagnostic and therapeutic entities within a single nanoparticle formulation, nanoparticles hold great promise for theranostic purposes and are considered to be highly useful for personalizing nanomedicine-based treatments. In this review article, we present applications of diagnostic and therapeutic nanoparticles, summarize frequently used non-invasive imaging techniques and describe the role of EPR in the accumulation of nanotheranostic formulations. In this context, the clinical potential of nanotheranostics and image-guided drug delivery for individualized and improved (chemo-) therapeutic interventions is addressed."
An update on the applications and characteristics of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for drug delivery.,"In the field of drug delivery, controlling the release of therapeutic substances at localized targets has become a primary focus of medical research, especially in the field of cancer treatment. Magnetic nanoparticles are one of the most promising drug carriers thanks to their biocompatibility and (super)paramagnetic properties. These properties allow for the combination between imaging modalities and specific release of drugs at target sites using either local stimulus (<i>i.e</i>. pH, conjugation of biomarkers, …) or external stimulus (<i>i.e</i>. external magnetic field)."
Nanoparticles for modulating tumor microenvironment to improve drug delivery and tumor therapy.,"Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in tumorigenesis, tumor invasion and metastasis. TME is composed of stroma, endothelial cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and immune cells, which is characterized by hypoxia, acidosis, and high interstitial fluid pressure. Due to the important role of TME, we firstly reviewed the composition of TME and discussed the impact of TME on tumor progression, drug and nanoparticle delivery. Next, we reviewed current strategies developed to modulate TME, including modulating tumor vasculature permeability, tumor associated macrophage phenotypes, tumor associated fibroblasts, tumor stroma components, tumor hypoxia, and multiple interventions simultaneously. Also, potential problems and future directions of TME modulation strategy have been discussed."
Strategies for Preparing Albumin-based Nanoparticles for Multifunctional Bioimaging and Drug Delivery.,"Biosafety is the primary concern in clinical translation of nanomedicine. As an intrinsic ingredient of human blood without immunogenicity and encouraged by its successful clinical application in Abraxane, albumin has been regarded as a promising material to produce nanoparticles for bioimaging and drug delivery. The strategies for synthesizing albumin-based nanoparticles could be generally categorized into five classes: template, nanocarrier, scaffold, stabilizer and albumin-polymer conjugate. This review introduces approaches utilizing albumin in the preparation of nanoparticles and thereby provides scientists with knowledge of goal-driven design on albumin-based nanomedicine."
Stability issues and approaches to stabilised nanoparticles based drug delivery system.,"Nanoparticles form the fundamental building blocks for many exciting applications in various scientific disciplines due to its unique features such as large surface to mass ratio, targeting potential, ability to adsorbed and carry other compound which makes them suitable for biomedical applications. However, the problem of the large-scale synthesis of nanoparticles remains challenging due to physical instability associated with nanoparticles which lead to generation of aggregates particles with high polydispersity index (PDI) indicating low particle homogeneity and eventually loss of their special nanoscale properties. The stabilisation concept can be generated by repulsive electrostatic force, which nanoparticles experience, when they are surrounded by a double layer of electric charges. Selection of proper stabiliser will govern the stability of NPs and ultimately development of optimised drug delivery system. This review summarises mechanism of physical instability issues likely to be encountered during the development of nanoformulations. It also discusses potential stabilising agents used so far and their mechanism in achieving stable nanosystems."
Nanoparticles and microparticles for skin drug delivery.,"Skin is a widely used route of delivery for local and systemic drugs and is potentially a route for their delivery as nanoparticles. The skin provides a natural physical barrier against particle penetration, but there are opportunities to deliver therapeutic nanoparticles, especially in diseased skin and to the openings of hair follicles. Whilst nanoparticle drug delivery has been touted as an enabling technology, its potential in treating local skin and systemic diseases has yet to be realised. Most drug delivery particle technologies are based on lipid carriers, i.e. solid lipid nanoparticles and nanoemulsions of around 300 nm in diameter, which are now considered microparticles. Metal nanoparticles are now recognized for seemingly small drug-like characteristics, i.e. antimicrobial activity and skin cancer prevention. We present our unpublished clinical data on nanoparticle penetration and previously published reports that support the hypothesis that nanoparticles >10nm in diameter are unlikely to penetrate through the stratum corneum into viable human skin but will accumulate in the hair follicle openings, especially after massage. However, significant uptake does occur after damage and in certain diseased skin. Current chemistry limits both atom by atom construction of complex particulates and delineating their molecular interactions within biological systems. In this review we discuss the skin as a nanoparticle barrier, recent work in the field of nanoparticle drug delivery to the skin, and future directions currently being explored."
Size shrinkable drug delivery nanosystems and priming the tumor microenvironment for deep intratumoral penetration of nanoparticles.,"The penetration of nanomedicine into solid tumor still constitutes a great challenge for cancer therapy, which lead to the failure of thorough clearance of tumor cells. Aiming at solving this issue, lots of encouraging progress has been made in the development of multistage nanoparticles triggered by various stimuli in the past few years. Besides, the therapeutical effects of nanoagents are also greatly impacted by the complex tumor microenvironment, and remodeling tumor microenvironment has become another important approach for promoting nanoparticles penetration. In this review, we summarize and analyze recent research progress and challenges in promoting nanoparticle penetration based on two kinds of different strategies, which include size shrinkable nanoparticles and priming tumor microenvironments. Especially, many recent reported multi-strategy approaches based on particle size reduction in conjugated with other therapeutic strategies are discussed. And we expect to provide some useful enlightenments and proposals on nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems for more effective therapy of solid tumors."
"Smart nanoparticles for responsive drug delivery in Diabetes: Advances, Challenges, and future Perspectives.","This review evaluates smart nanoparticle systems in diabetes management as drug delivery systems that have changed the way treatments for diabetes have been delivered. Diabetes, which includes both type 1 and type 2 forms, represents a significant challenge to human health worldwide. Traditional methods of treating diabetes include manual insulin injections, which, however, suffer from substantial drawbacks: noncompliance and inaccuracies in doses. Smart nanoparticles that can be engineered to physiologically respond to specific stimuli related to diabetes will be a means for achieving better targeted and controlled release delivery of therapeutic agents. This review gives a broad overview of the classes of nanoparticles being developed: polymeric, inorganic, lipid-based, and hybrid systems used in glucose-responsive insulin delivery and oral insulin formulations.

Such developments are a great leap toward more effective and patient-centered diabetes care."
Innovations in Core-Shell Nanoparticles: Advancing Drug Delivery Solutions and Precision Medicine.,"Drug delivery innovation is an important pillar of systems pharmacology wherein nanotechnology offers significant prospects. This expert review examines and unpacks how core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) could revolutionize drug delivery systems and play a key role in advancing personalized and precision medicine. Core-shell NPs have gained attention as flexible tools for drug delivery due to their distinct structure, which features a core material enclosed by a protective shell. This setup offers multiple benefits, such as effective drug encapsulation, shielding the drug from degradation, and allowing for controlled release. Accordingly, the core serves as a safe storage area for the drug while the shell manages the release speed, providing added stability and supporting sustained delivery. By enabling targeted drug release, this controlled mechanism can help improve treatment outcomes and reduce side effects. Various materials, including polymers, lipids, and inorganic substances create these NPs. Biodegradable polymers, such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and poly(lactic acid), are popular choices because they offer adjustable degradation rates, which further control how the drug is released. These materials can be tailored for better drug loading, compatibility with the host organism, and specific chemical properties to suit different therapeutic needs. Research into core-shell NPs has been advancing in many therapeutic areas, highlighting their potential for drug delivery innovations. The potential of core-shell NPs to revolutionize drug delivery is not just a possibility but a promising reality that could significantly advance the field of personalized/precision medicine."

Delivery Strategy to Enhance the Therapeutic Efficacy of Liver Fibrosis via Nanoparticle Drug Delivery Systems.,"Liver fibrosis (LF) is a pathological repair reaction caused by a chronic liver injury that affects the health of millions of people worldwide, progressing to life-threatening cirrhosis and liver cancer without timely intervention. Due to the complexity of LF pathology, multiple etiological characteristics, and the deposited extracellular matrix, traditional drugs cannot reach appropriate targets in a time-space matching way, thus decreasing the therapeutic effect. Nanoparticle drug delivery systems (NDDS) enable multidrug co-therapy and develop multifactor delivery strategies targeting pathological processes, showing great potential in LF therapy. Based on the pathogenesis and the current clinical treatment status of LF, we systematically elucidate the targeting mechanism of NDDS used in the treatment of LF. Subsequently, we focus on the progress of drug delivery applications for LF, including combined delivery for the liver fibrotic pathological environment, overcoming biological barriers, precise intracellular regulation, and intelligent responsive delivery for the liver fibrotic microenvironment. We hope that this review will inspire the rational design of NDDS for LF in the future in order to provide ideas and methods for promoting LF regression and cure."
Inorganic-organic Synergy in Nano-hybrids Makes a New Class of Drug with Targeted Delivery: Glutamate Functionalization of Iron Nanoparticles for Potential Bone Marrow Delivery and X-ray Dynamic Therapy.,"The direct delivery of therapeutic molecules is generally inefficient and has several problems. Hence, nanomedicines with targeted and controlled delivery applications have been an exciting field of research for the past decade. In this regard, the adjustable properties of inorganic nanoparticles like particle size distribution, ability to change the targeting ligand to have a higher affinity towards the pathologic cell, and controlled delivery properties have made them indispensable for targeted drug delivery applications. Changing the ligand on the surface of the inorganic nanoparticle can direct different therapeutic molecules to different organs like the liver, spleen, kidney, bone, and even brain. However, while the other targeted nanomedicines are well-reported, the targeting of therapeutics to bone marrow cells is sparse in the literature. Hence, the administration of therapeutics for bone-related disorders, like bone metastases, leads to several problems, such as severe systemic toxicity and suboptimal efficacy. In this direction, we have shown our successful effort to functionalise a model inorganic nanoparticle (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) by glutamate ligand which is reported to have a high affinity towards the NMDA receptors of the bone cells. We have performed spectroscopic studies to characterize the nano-hybrid. We have shown that the cargo or the Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> nanoparticle possesses the ability to generate photo-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby leading to a therapeutic opportunity for bone metastases. In addition, the nanoparticle also possesses the ability to generate enhanced ROS on X-ray irradiation, which may provide a new strategy for bone metastases and cancer therapy. Also, this paper reviews the advancement in the drug delivery applications of inorganic nanoparticles and highlights the crosstalk between the inorganic nanoparticles with the conjugated targeting ligand for efficient delivery applications."

Photocleavage-based Photoresponsive Drug Delivery.,"Targeted drug delivery has been extensively studied in the last decade, whereas both passive and active targeting strategies still face many challenges, such as off-target drug release. Light-responsive drug delivery systems have been developed with high controllability and spatio-temporal resolution to improve drug efficacy and reduce off-target drug release. Photoremovable protecting groups are light-responsive moieties that undergo irreversible photocleavage reactions upon light irradiation. They can be covalently linked to the molecule of interest to control its structure and function with light. In this review, we will summarize recent applications of photocleavage technologies in nanoparticle-based drug delivery for precise targeting and controlled drug release, with a highlight of strategies to achieve long-wavelength light excitation. A greater understanding of these mechanisms and emerging studies will help design more efficient photocleavage-based nanosystems to advance photoresponsive drug delivery."

A Comprehensive Review on Nanoparticles as Drug Delivery System and Their Role for Management of Hypertension.,"The current global epidemic of hypertension is not a disease in and of itself but rather a significant risk factor for serious cardiovascular conditions such as peripheral artery disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Although many medications that work through various mechanisms of action are available on the market in conventional formulations to treat hypertension, these medications face significant difficulties with their bioavailability, dosing, and associated side effects, which significantly reduces the effectiveness of their therapeutic interventions. Numerous studies have shown that nanocarriers and nanoformulations can minimize the toxicity associated with high doses of the drug while greatly increasing the drug's bioavailability and reducing the frequency of dosing. This review sheds light on the difficulties posed by traditional antihypertensive formulations and highlights the necessity of oral nanoparticulate systems to solve these issues. Because hypertension has a circadian blood pressure pattern, chronotherapeutics can be very important in treating the condition. On the other hand, nanoparticulate systems can be very important in managing hypertension."
"Chitosan Nanoparticles: Approaches to Preparation, Key Properties, Drug Delivery Systems, and Developments in Therapeutic Efficacy.","The integration of nanotechnology into drug delivery systems holds great promise for enhancing pharmaceutical effectiveness. This approach enables precise targeting, controlled release, improved patient compliance, reduced side effects, and increased bioavailability. Nanoparticles are vital for transporting biomolecules-such as proteins, enzymes, genes, and vaccines-through various administration routes, including oral, intranasal, vaginal, buccal, and pulmonary. Among biodegradable polymers, chitosan, a linear polysaccharide derived from chitin, stands out due to its biocompatibility, safety, biodegradability, mucoadhesive properties, and ability to enhance permeation. Its cationic nature supports strong molecular interactions and provides antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and hemostatic benefits.

Nano-scale drug delivery systems for luteolin: advancements and applications.,"Luteolin (Lu) is a naturally occurring flavonoid compound with a diverse array of pharmacological activities, including anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and neuroprotective properties. However, the therapeutic efficacy and clinical application of Lu are significantly hindered by inherent limitations, such as poor water solubility, short half-life, low bioavailability, and potential off-target toxicity. Recent studies have demonstrated that the utilization of nanocarriers presents a promising strategy to enhance the solubility of Lu, prolong its circulation time, and improve its targeting ability. Despite numerous reviews over the past few decades having focused on the source, pharmacological activities, and molecular mechanisms of Lu, there exists a conspicuous gap in the literature regarding a comprehensive review of Lu-loaded nanoformulations and their applications. To address this gap, we present an exhaustive overview of the advancements and applications of nano-scale drug delivery systems specifically designed for Lu. These platforms encompass micelles, nanocarrier-based systems, emulsified drug delivery systems, and vesicular drug delivery systems. We provide detailed insights into the synthetic materials, preparation methods, physicochemical properties, and significant outcomes associated with these nanoformulations. This systematic review will be particularly valuable to researchers seeking novel avenues in the field of nano-delivery strategies and exploring the potential clinical applications of Lu."

Stimuli-responsive nanoparticle-nanofiber hybrids for drug delivery and photodynamic therapy.,"Hybrid nanomaterials possess integrated multi-components to syncretize various properties and functions within a single entity. Owing to this synergistic effect, they promise efficient anti-cancer therapy. In line with this target, we produced stimuli-responsive nanoparticle-nanofiber hybrids (NNHs) via embedding photoresponsive natural melanin nanoparticles (MNPs) within a biocompatible polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber matrix. Electrospinning was performed to produce monolithic and core-shell structured NNHs using a single and a coaxial nozzle. The NNHs were upgraded to drug delivery systems by model hydrophilic drug-ampicillin (amp)-loading. The drug release results showed that monolithic PCL meshes displayed a burst release, whereas nanohybrid formation with MNPs improved the release profile toward Fickian diffusion. Core-shell NNH presented a more sustained drug release profile than its MNP-free replica and monolithic NNH because its encapsulating shell layer hindered the diffusion of the drug. The photodynamic therapy accompanied by UV-A-irradiation on monolithic and core-shell NNHs yielded up to 34 % and 37 % malignant melanoma cell death. Moreover, this study proved the potency of MNPs-enhanced NNHs in drug delivery and photodynamic therapy applications.

The integration of cell-mediated drug delivery and theranostic nanomedicine can potentially improve cancer management in both therapeutic and diagnostic applications. By taking advantage of innate immune cell's ability to target tumor cells, the authors develop a novel drug delivery system by using macrophages as both nanoparticle (NP) carriers and navigators to achieve cancer-specific drug delivery. Theranostic NPs are fabricated from a unique polymer, biodegradable photoluminescent poly (lactic acid) (BPLP-PLA), which possesses strong fluorescence, biodegradability, and cytocompatibility. In order to minimize the toxicity of cancer drugs to immune cells and other healthy cells, an anti-BRAF V600E mutant melanoma specific drug (PLX4032) is loaded into BPLP-PLA nanoparticles. Muramyl tripeptide is also conjugated onto the nanoparticles to improve the nanoparticle loading efficiency. The resulting nanoparticles are internalized within macrophages, which are tracked via the intrinsic fluorescence of BPLP-PLA. Macrophages carrying nanoparticles deliver drugs to melanoma cells via cell-cell binding. Pharmacological studies also indicate that the PLX4032 loaded nanoparticles effectively kill melanoma cells.

Nanoparticles and microparticles as vaccine-delivery systems.,"Vaccine-delivery systems are generally particulate (e.g., emulsions, microparticles and liposomes) and have comparable dimensions to the pathogens, which the immune system evolved to combat. Increasingly more sophisticated delivery systems are being developed in which immunostimulatory adjuvants may be incorporated with the antigen. The rationale for this approach is to ensure that both the antigen and adjuvant are delivered into the same population of antigen-presenting cells. Enhancement of adjuvant activity through the use of micro- and nanoparticulate delivery systems is particularly exciting, as synergistic effects are often seen resulting in immune responses stronger than those elicited by the adjuvant or delivery system alone.

For instance, cylindrical or needle-like NPs may facilitate better cellular uptake compared to spherical NPs. Lastly, we address the importance of nanoparticle charge. Zeta potential can impact the targeting and cellular uptake of NPs. Positively charged NPs may be better absorbed by negatively charged cells, whereas negatively charged NPs might perform more effectively in positively charged cells. This review provides essential insights into understanding the role of nanoparticles in drug delivery. The properties of nanoparticles, including size, shape, and charge, should be taken into consideration in the rational design of drug delivery systems, as optimizing these characteristics can contribute to more efficient targeting of drugs to the desired tissues.

Recent Advances in Nanoparticle-Based Targeted Drug-Delivery Systems Against Cancer and Role of Tumor Microenvironment.,"Cancer is one of the major causes of death worldwide. The silent activation of cellular factors responsible for deviation from normal regulatory pathways leads to the development of cancer. Nano-biotechnology is a novel drug-delivery system with high potential of efficacy and accuracy to target lethal cancers. Various biocompatible nanoparticle (NP)-based drug-delivery systems such as liposomes, dendrimers, micelles, silica, quantum dots, and magnetic, gold, and carbon nanotubes have already been reported for successful targeted cancer treatment. NPs are functionalized with different biological molecules, peptides, antibody, and protein ligands for targeted drug delivery. These systems include a hydrophilic central core, a target-oriented biocompatible outer layer, and a middle hydrophobic core where the drug destined to reach target site resides.
